```

### Configuration

```yaml
providers:
  googlecloud:
    class: octodns_googlecloud.GoogleCloudProvider
    # Credentials file for a service_account or other account can be
    # specified with the GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS environment
    # variable. (https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials)
    #
    # The project to work on (not required)
    # project: foobar
    #
    # The File with the google credentials (not required). If used, the
    # "project" parameter needs to be set, else it will fall back to the
    #  "default credentials"
    # credentials_file: ~/google_cloud_credentials_file.json
    #
    # If multiple DNS zone have the same DNS name, it's possible
    # to filter on zone name field based on his prefix. It's a workaround 
    # to handle private/public zone type based on the prefix zone name. 
    # zone_prefix: private
    #
    # GoogleCloudProvider submits changes in batches. The default batch size
    # is 1000, which is also roughly the maximum size that google supports.
    # If your plan & apply makes more than batch_size changes they will be
    # broken up into smaller sets of at most that size.
    # batch_size: 1000
```

### Development

See the [/script/](/script/) directory for some tools to help with the development process. They generally follow the [Script to rule them all](https://github.com/github/scripts-to-rule-them-all) pattern. Most useful is `./script/bootstrap` which will create a venv and install both the runtime and development related requirements. It will also hook up a pre-commit hook that covers most of what's run by CI.
